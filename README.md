## Software Projects

### Next Trip

A web application which provides insight on times and locations a driver could get more rides based on past rides data

- Give driver a location where they are highly likely to get a ride according to day and time and location of the driver.
- Processes the data and make a model to predict the rider location according to time using RandomForestRegressor
- Give a heat map of rides to show how the demand spreads.
- Give insights of rider pickups by day and hour.
  Update the models and insights periodically with new rides.
- Utilized : ReactJS ,MongoDB ,Python, jupyter notebook, flask ,REST APIs
